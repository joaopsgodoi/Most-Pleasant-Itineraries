# Most-Pleasant-Itineraries

To run the codes itineraries_v1, itineraries_v2 and itineraries_v3, you need to put them in one document.

itineraries_v3, for example, needs some functions that have been defined in itineraries_v1. 

we chose to organize them like this to make it easier for the corrector to see them.

If you want to look at the entire code, feel free to look in the "Complete code and Colab Notebook" folder.
